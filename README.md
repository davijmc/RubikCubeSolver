# RubikCubeSolver
Codebase for my project aimed at creating an automated machine capable of solving and assembling Rubik's cubes

MySolver.cpp contains my attempt to create a C++ code that is capable of solving and assembling a Rubik's Cube. Later, it will be replaced with a better version that already exists on the internet.
