# RubikCubeSolver
Codebase for my project aimed at creating an automated machine capable of solving and assembling Rubik's Cubes.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The file MySolver.cpp contains my attempt to create a C++ code capable of simulating, solving, and assembling a Rubik's Cube.

README WILL BE IMPROVED SOON
=======
- MySolver.cpp will contains my attempt to create a C++ code capable of simulating, solving, and assembling a Rubik's Cube.
- CubeSimulator.cpp contains the cube simulator using matrix.
- csDebugger.cpp contains the debugger version of CubeSimulator to help me to discover why it don't work perfectly
